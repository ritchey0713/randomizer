This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here I have made a React App for randomly selecting a option the user has input

To emulate having a back-end or DB I have the app save to local storage 

Sass was used with Flex-box to style this project 

Abstract away as much as possible to be functional/ presentation variables/classes

Much of this code will be basic React 

Please feel free to clone this down for your own use!
